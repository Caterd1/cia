    <P>LANGLEY, VA—A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the CIA has mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black highlighters.</P>

    <p2>According to the report, sections of the documents— "almost invariably the most crucial passages"—are marred by an indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that began at the agency's inception in 1947.</p2>
      <br> 
      <br>     
    <p3>CIA Director Porter Goss lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of several historic events, such as: </p3>
        <ul>
         <li>the Cold War</li>
         <li>the Civil-Rights Movement</li>
         <li>the growth of the international drug trade</li>
        </ul>
